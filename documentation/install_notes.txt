Build issues on Ubuntu 12.10

Non-haskell stuff:
- Requires libwxgtk2.8-dev package

Haskell stuff:
- Needs stm > 2.4  (haskell platform and Ubuntu are both at 2.2)
- wxhaskell: wxc-0.8 required, install via cabal w/ constraints

Example pre-installation steps:

sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev 
sudo apt-get install libghc-zeromq-haskell-dev 

sudo cabal install stm --global
sudo cabal install wx --constraint="wxc < 0.9" --global

sudo cabal install opengl openglraw gluraw glfw-b

Depending on the history, you may have to bring wxc up to date with the new stm:
sudo cabal install wx --constraint="wxc < 0.9" --global --reinstall


OpenGL performance is pretty important.  Use glxgears to make sure that graphics accelleration is running smoothly (~3000 fps).  If things appear jerky, try disabling "Sync to VBlank" under nvidia-settings -> OpenGL Settings
